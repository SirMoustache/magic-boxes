# Magic Boxes



This is toy realization of Monads just to understand them. Well, that was the main idea.  :/

## Installation

`npm install --save magic-boxes`

## IO (Input/Output) Monad

So this is like a cheat in FP world. Impure function stays pure until you run it. So push this run to the edges or even outside of applications with lazy functions.

Usage 

```javaScript
import { IO } from 'magic-boxes';
```

## Documentation
[It ain't much...](docs)

## Building yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SirMoustache/magic-boxes.git
cd magic-boxes
npm install
npm run build
```

## TODO
- [ ] IO Monad
- [ ] IO Monat examples
- [ ] More items to TODO list
